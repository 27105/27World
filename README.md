# BonziWORLD 2: Remaked
The BonziWORLD-Two.ga website has been discontinued because Seamus replaced it with his newer websites. This project is made as the only remake.
All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run BonziWORLD 2, by all means go ahead.
Do whatever you'd like with this code.
Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD 2 to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/ItzUltraChace/BonziWORLD-2-Remaked
cd BonziWORLD 2 Remaked
```

### Client
```
cd src
npm install
cd ..
```

### Server
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD 2 will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
